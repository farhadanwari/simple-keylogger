# Simple Python Keylogger and Credentials Analyzer
This is a simple keylogger program written in Python using the pynput and re libraries. It captures all the user's keystrokes and saves them to a file, which can then be analyzed to search for email addresses and passwords. The program uses regular expressions to search for patterns that match the standard email and password formats.

The output displays all the emails and passwords found. The program can be used for educational purposes, such as understanding how keyloggers work, or for more practical reasons, such as testing the security of your accounts.

# How to Use
1. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in the terminal:
* ```pip install pynput```
* ```pip install re```
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the files are saved.
4. Run the keylogger.py script by typing the following command:
```python3 keylogger.py```
This will start the keylogger program.
5. Type in your desired email addresses and passwords.
6. To stop the program, press the ESC key.
Once the program is stopped, it will save the keystrokes in a file named keystrokes.txt in the same directory.
The program will display any emails and passwords found in the file.
