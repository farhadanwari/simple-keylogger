# simple-keylogger
This is a simple keylogger program written in Python using the pynput and re libraries. It captures all the user's keystrokes and saves them to a file, which can then be analyzed to search for email addresses and passwords. The program uses regular expressions to search for patterns that match the standard email and password formats.
